Privacy Policy
=====================

Bouncer requires read access to your SMS messages and sender information to perform filtering.

Different from other apps. Bouncer does not upload or send SMS messages or sender information to a remote server.   All the filtering happens 100% locally on your phone, which means developers or third parties will never have access to such data.  

For added privacy, the app does not store local copies of your messages or their contents, and message filtering happens in real time when your messages reach your phone.

Bouncer is designed with privacy in mind, will always be open source, and will never collect usage data or track you in any way.
