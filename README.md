## Bouncer SMS Filter

This is a simple SMS filtering app for iOS that uses the ILMessageFilterExtension to move unwanted and specific messages to the "Junk", "Promotion" and "Transaction" sections of the Messages app.

Different to other apps, Bouncer does not share, upload or send any of your personal information or SMS messages to a remote server.   All the filtering happens locally on your phone.

Messages text is checked against a simple user defined blacklist.

## Features
* Filter SMS messages using a simple list of words
* Catalog filtered messages in iOS 14+ categories (Junk, Transaction, Promotion)
* Unlimited number of filter rules
* Localized in English, Spanish and Arabic
* Supports both word lists and regular expressions
